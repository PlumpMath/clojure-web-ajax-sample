clojure-web-ajax-sample
=======================

A sample ajax-based web application written in Clojure and using ClojureScript
and Noir libraries.

The goal is to provide those who are new to ClojureScript or Noir with a fully functional web application which they can extend or modify easily.  To keep the
code clean and easy to read and understand, I've avoided beautifying the UI and
playing with CSS as much as possible.
